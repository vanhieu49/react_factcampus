                Hi. This is Fast Campus.<br /><br />
                Currently, Kakao's simple subscription function is temporarily suspended due 
                to internal system improvement work.
                If you have previously signed up for Kakao, you can log in normally.
                <br /><br />
                We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
                We will do our best to get the job done as soon as possible.
                Thank you.
                <br /><br />
                Effective date and time
                <br />
